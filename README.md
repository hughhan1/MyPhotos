This is a personal website that I built to become more familiar using model-view-controller architecture, and learn [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org), [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com), [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org). Along the way, I also learned a bit of [Bootstrap](http://getboostrap.com) from playing around with the front end. 

#### Notes ####
Using mode-view-controller seems kind of unnecessary, and NodeJS + MongoDB seems to be a bit of an overkill for a personal website.

I wanted some experience with the MEAN stack, and built specific parts of my website around the idea that I had a database. For example, I use MongoDB to store the paths to the images that are displayed as well as all replies from viewers.

#### Status ####
My website is finally deployed! Check it out [here](http://hughhan.me).
